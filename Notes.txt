So we are building a web tech project

Objectives of Project:
•The aim is to design a unique web application for it.
•Develop  a  web  application  with  8-10  distinct  web  pages  with  rich  front-end functionality (Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript and React Framework)
•Include  backend  support  for  at  least  two  web  pages  using  backend  framework Nodejs, Express APIs and Database (MongoDB)
•While  there  may  be  a  few  traditional  pages  like  About  Us,  Contact  Us,  Team, Feedback  Form,  Login,  register  etc,  the  main  is  innovative 

We should work on all layers of the application (Front-end, Server-end and Database)

Project Title: Digital Skill Swap Platform

Group Name: SkillShareU
Description: Develop a platform where students can offer to teach skills they are proficient in (e.g., coding, photography, graphic design) and, in exchange, learn new skills from others. 
This peer-to-peer learning platform could foster a community of knowledge exchange, tailored to college students’ needs. While skill-sharing is a known concept, 
implementing it within a college setting with an easy-to-use platform is quite unique.
